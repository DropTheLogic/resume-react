Greetings! Please allow me to introduce myself. /n I started out in print media as the Art Director of a small magazine, right out of college. But when print dried up, I switched to the restaurant industry, in part to allow myself the flexibility to write, rehearse and record music. After managing a restaurant became my day job as well as my night job, I looked for a more meaning from my career. I switched my free time from music to learning how to code. /n After a couple years studying and building front-end apps on my own, the immersive program at Fullstack Academy formalized my commitment to the industry, burnished my knowledge, and empowered me to work as a software engineer. Now I look forward to building software that helps to inspire and improve the lives of people everyday.
