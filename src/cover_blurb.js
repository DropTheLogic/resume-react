Greetings! Please allow me to introduce myself. I graduated from NYU in 2001 with an Individualized Study degree concentrating in Technology in the Arts. More recently, I completed the front-end web development Nanodegree from Udacity, mostly coding in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. /n Along the way Iâ€™ve been a musician, worked in graphic design and in the hospitality industry, and learned the fundamentals of programming (in C++/Objective-C, Java, Ruby and Python). I continue to learn new technologies every day by building small web apps in my free time.
